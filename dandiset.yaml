description: 'Spontaneous neuronal activities were extracted from GCaMP and tagRFP
  images, covering nearly all neurons in the nematode C. elegans brain. In addition,
  neuronal identity information was derived from NeuroPAL signals. During the data
  acquisition, the worms were semi-immobilized in a microfluidic device. Note: There
  are occasional transient failures in neuronal tracking. We recommend that researchers
  use a moving median filter (e.g., Â±3) to address this issue.'
